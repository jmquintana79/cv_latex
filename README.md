# CV into LATEX

This one is my resume into Latex. <a href="https://latex-project.org/guides/" target="\_blank">Latex</a> is a markup language very convenient to build awesome documents as for example resumes or scientific papers.

In my case I have used <a href="http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/" target="\_blank">TeXShop</a> to work in Mac Os X. When this software is installed also are installed all libraries necessary to compile any 'tex' file. 

It is possible work with this graphical tool but also It is possible improve a 'text' document with your favorite editor and compilate directly from terminal.

In order to compilate from terminal to get a pdf output it is necessary use:

<pre><code data-trim class="bash">
$ pdflatex document.tex
</code></pre>
